# First 100 Days of Coding (started 1 Feb 2025) Project
From Tech with Tim Tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ml4x0rO1PQ at 6:45

# Why Tutorials instead of my own projects?
1. I'm starting from scratch again and not ready to create my own projects.
2. While I'm studying The Odin Project, I can see how Tim writes his code and why he writes it that way.
3. I'm learning what my programming preferences are.

# What I changed:
1. Added a styles.css file - Tim had the CSS in the html. I don't like that.
2. Used defer for the js script in the head. For now, I prefer it there than at the bottom. 
3. Titled files as index.html, script.js, and styles.css. I'm trying to make that my status quo.
4. Since I used hex colors instead of straight-up or rgb, I commented out the rgb method and added a hex randomizer.
5. Used colorValue rather than name for the setColor() parameter.
